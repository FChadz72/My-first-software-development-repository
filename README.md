I am an enthusiastic and self driven chemistry graduate and current computer science Masters student at the university of law. I have a vast set of transferrible skills due to my dexterity in practicing both sciences. I am results-oriented and committed yo using my skills yo achieve set goals and objectives. I have an interest in AI engineering, solutions architecture, softaware development and data analysis.
I have managed to learn a lot about the basics of software versioning, with a specific focus on Github. I have learnt the differences between centralised and decentralised versioning including the advantages and disadvantages of both.
